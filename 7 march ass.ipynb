    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify the spread or variability of a dataset. Here's how they are used and an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread by capturing the total span of the data. However, it only considers the extreme values and doesn't account for the distribution of values in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It calculates the dispersion by considering the differences between each value and the mean of the dataset. A higher variance indicates a greater spread, while a lower variance suggests that the data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the typical or average deviation of each data point from the mean. Like variance, a higher standard deviation implies a larger spread, while a lower standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say we have a dataset representing the daily temperatures (in degrees Celsius) in a city for a week: [25, 26, 23, 24, 27, 22, 25].\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value (22) from the maximum value (27), resulting in a range of 5 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: To calculate the variance, we first find the mean of the dataset (24.57). Then, we find the squared difference between each value and the mean, sum them up, and divide by the total number of values. The variance of the dataset is approximately 1.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. In this case, the standard deviation is approximately 1.40 degrees."

The median can be less affected by the outlier, but it still may not accurately represent the center of the data if the outlier is far from the other values.

The mean age of this group would be heavily skewed towards the outlier, making it an unreliable measure of the central tendency.

The outlier value of 100 can cause the range to be larger, and the variance and standard deviation to be higher, indicating more spread in the dataset. The standard deviation would be a less reliable measure of the spread of the data in this case due to the presence of the outlier value."
